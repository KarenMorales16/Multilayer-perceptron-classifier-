**Definition**
MLPs are forward-directed networks with one or more node layers between the input nodes and the output nodes (Hidden). Each neuron is a perceptron type. Each layer is fully connected to the next layer in the network.

Perceptron: Artificial neuron or basic inference unit in the form of a linear discriminator, from which an algorithm is developed capable of generating a criterion to select a sub-group from a larger group of components.
